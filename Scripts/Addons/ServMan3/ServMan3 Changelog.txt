-- 3.0.1 for DCS:A-10C

Fixes:
- Fixed saving bantables
- Minor fixes with server pause / unpause, previous release did not include the updated code.
- Fixed kick, failed due to saving of bantables
- Minor fixes for the Set command as well as helptexts.
- Fixed a problem with sloppy coding in the Auto-restart of a mission, when mission wouldn't load as expected.
- Timeset would not work if mission_restart was used instead of mission_rotate. Devs has been given a crashcourse into checking their own code before release, this wont happen again.

Changes:
- /HELP made more useful. You can now search for parts of any keyword. Eg /help ban or /help list
- Lifting a ban now leaves a comment about who lifted the ban.
- ServMan will use "\Saved Games\DCS Warthog\ServMan3" for any saving - or loading modded configs.
All saving will happen in this directory. Will not longer save files in the DCS install directory.

NEW *** Custom config can be SAVED or LOADED. ***
With the config profiles, you can now quickly load a PUBLIC or SQUAD config if you like.
When settings are saved, all the relevant SERVMAN settings will be saved to a new file
in the "\Saved Games\DCS Warthog\ServMan3".

CONFIG Syntax:
	/CONF SAVE MyPublicConf or /CONF LOAD public
	or just /CONF

Explanation: 
	- 'SAVE' and 'LOAD' are keywords.
	- SAVE: MyPublicConf is the name for the file.
	- LOAD: 'public' acts as a filter, loading first file matching 'public', which is 'MyPublicConf'.
Without the keywords, CONF will list available configs.

About the files:
	- Files will be assigned the prefix CONF_ and suffix .lua. Ex: "CONF_MyPublicConf.lua" or "CONF_noTeamKills.lua" etc
	- Files are saved in or loaded from the "\Saved Games\DCS Warthog\ServMan3"
/INFO now includes the config which is in effect.

NEW *** miz_rotate_announcement: Will do a onscreen countdown before mission rotate / restart.
Will display a "time left before restart / rotate"
In the serverconfig.lua:
	-- NOTE: Order must be incremental, smallest numbers first.
	-- miz_rotate_announcement = { 1,2,3,4,5,10,15,60,120,180 },	-- at 3 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour, 15 mins, 10 mins, and every min from 5 to 1 min
	-- miz_rotate_announcement = { 1,5,10,15,60 },			-- at 1 hour, 15 mins, 10 mins, 5 min and final call at 1 min.
	-- miz_rotate_announcement = { 0 }, 				-- disabled
	miz_rotate_announcement = { 1,2,3,4,5,10,15,60 },

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3.0 for DCS:A-10C

- Compatability with DCS:A-10C 1.1.0.7+
Not for DCS:BS 1.0.2 nor FC2 1.0.2
- Minor fixes with server pause / unpause.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2.5 beta 11 for FC2 + DCS:BS

- "/Set kicks=off" didn't quite work in all situations. Fixed.
- "/ban somename comment here" didnt work as expected. Only /ban <id> worked. Fixed.
- "/kick someone" banned them instead of kicking them. Fixed.
- Ban-comments are now saved to the "conf_banned.lua" file.
- Server-pause wasnt respected in some situation when server was started by advanced commanline parameters. Fixed.
- /ver added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2.5 beta 10 for FC2 + DCS:BS
- New commandline interface, most commands been reworked.
Notice:
1. that most commands now support shortvariants such as /pl /h /mi /ki panz
2. no more ":" being used in commands, only " " a space to separate the words.
Full online help for all commands. See more detail online, /help, /help admin, /help mission
NOTE: Help will ONLY list the commands a user has permission to use. Admins will have more commands and help available.
---
- Kick, ban, playerlist, vote-kick all now supports names, or parts of names
A few commands also supports multiple names/id in one go.
Where 'namefilters' can be used, such as in /players, it will list only the players which is matching the filter.
Check /k ? /pl ? /v ? for more details.
---
- New commands: /whoami and /who <id>|namefilter
See /who ? fore more details.
---
- Squad-login mode, one username and password for the full squad.
Can also check that the member is using the correct tags in his name before allowing him to log on.
Squad members will become mini-admins, just a few commands short of full admin.
See /log ? more more details.
See SERVERCONFIG.LUA and Squad section for configuration.
---
- conf_serverconfig.lua: Kicklevel=number
Decides which accesslevel servman are allowed to kick. There are 5 levels.
0 = anon, 1 = friend (not used yet), 2 = squadmember, 3 = admin, 4 = superadmin
If kicklevel is set to 2, kicks & bans will reach out and touch squad-members and those below.
---
- Save and load Server-config to a separate file.
/save conf
Will save the current server configuration to "conf_serverconfig.lua". This will become your custom config file which
can be loaded again by using:
/load conf
Note: To load server-defaults, use /reinit
Note2: Server always loads DEFAULTS at startup.
You then have to use /load conf to get your custom config if thats what you wish.
---

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2.1.6 alpha for FC2
- Internal build. Servman moved out of \Scripts\net into \Scripts\Addons\Servman2
- Started working on the new command interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2.1.5 alpha for FC2
- Quickfix: Onscreen Warning when there are syntax errors in Serverconfig.lua
Previously the server would have suffered quietly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
-- v.2.1.4 alpha for FC2
Resolved:
- Kick+Ban in all variants works as expected.
- UNKNOWN PLAYER messages is gone.
- Fixed a minor problem with first mission in the mission list being repeated twice when mission-rotation was active.

Improvements:
- TEAM-chat messages is prefixed to all recievers with "#TEAMMSG: "
  If you see "#TEAMMSG Tally bandit 310 for 40" from a BLUE - then RED cant see it and you know it's intended for your team only.
  Note: When *you* type a TEAMMSG you wont see "#TEAMMSG" on your screen.
- /missions now indicates which mission that is loaded and active. Look for ->1<- around the mission ID.
- Chat-loggin. Look for the "ServMan-Chatlog-<datetime>.log". It will now log everything you see in the chat on the server. Kills, deaths, damages, kicks etc.
- Server-logging. Look for the "ServMan-Serverlog-<datetime>.log"
  New "loglevel" variable for logging detail level, see "serverconfig.lua" for details. Valid levels are 0 to 3.
  Note: The format in the file may change in the future.
  For you who look for a file to parse for your web - don't despair.
  Coming soon is a pure "result / stats" based log.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
